The parameters were estimated using IQ-TREE 2.2.2.7

using 
- the published tree with fixed branch lengths (-te Newick-Tree-Suppl4-renamed-comments_deleted.tree)
- the published alignment (-s SSU-MSA-Suppl3-renamed.fasta)
- GTR+G4 model (-m GTR+G4)
- keeping also all identical sequences (-keep-ident)

without
- branch optimization (-blfix)
- tree seatch (-n 0)

furthermore
- site proportions and rate were output per site (-wspr)
