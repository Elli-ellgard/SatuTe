USER TREE
---------

Log-likelihood of the tree: -21.7052 (s.e. 2.0333)
Unconstrained log-likelihood (without tree): -5.5452
Number of free parameters (#branches + #model parameters): 0
Akaike information criterion (AIC) score: 43.4103
Corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) score: 43.4103
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score: 43.4103

Total tree length (sum of branch lengths): 5.4296
Sum of internal branch lengths: 1.9729 (36.3352% of tree length)

WARNING: 1 near-zero internal branches (<0.2500) should be treated with caution
         Such branches are denoted by '**' in the figure below

NOTE: Tree is UNROOTED although outgroup taxon 'FOO' is drawn at root

ALISIM COMMAND
--------------
To simulate an alignment of the same length as the original alignment, using the tree and model parameters estimated from this analysis, you can use the following command:

--alisim simulated_MSA -t output.treefile -m "TIM{1,0.0001,0.6854}+FU{0.29713,0.210121,0.210121,0.282628}" --length 4

To mimic the alignment used to produce this analysis, i.e. simulate an alignment of the same length as the original alignment, using the tree and model parameters estimated from this analysis *and* copying the same gap positions as the original alignment, you can use the following command:

iqtree -s sequence.txt --alisim mimicked_MSA

To simulate any number of alignments in either of the two commandlines above, use the --num-alignments options, for example mimic 100 alignments you would use the command line:

iqtree -s sequence.txt --alisim mimicked_MSA --num-alignments 100
