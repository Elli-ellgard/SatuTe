tree-abl0.1-bbl0.1-cbl3.5_-_A8+B8_-_1500bp_-_LG
-----------------------------------------------

Trees with two subtrees of 8 taxa each, named A1... A8, B1... B8.
The branches inside the subtrees are set to 0.1.

The internal branch linking the subtrees is set to 
3.5 (substitutions per site.

The DNA alignments of length 1500bp were simulated 
using seq-gen under the LG+G model with the model's 
stationary frequencies and a continuous Gamma 
distribution using alpha=0.8.

The file simtree.tree contain the trees in phylip format, 
used for the simulation. (same for all alignments)
The file simtree-labelled.tree contain the the same 
topologies, but the inner nodes are labelled with "Node1*" etc.
